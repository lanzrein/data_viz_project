# A study of work patterns in co-housing communities
## Data vizualisation project 
### Authors

This project is done with the agent based model created by the FHNW. 
Thus all of the code concerning the agent based model has been done on an other project and we have not contributed at all to it. 
Our work is only on the visualization.
### Abstract 


### Currently doing : 
- Working on getting an embryo that is fully compatible with the code of the original project
- Use D3 to first a non interactive viz of the agents ( as soon as it is done we will move to interactive viz) 
	- One part of the viz will be consacrated to the history of the simulation and how it has evolved
	- One other part will focus on the current state of the simulation at the current tick

### Challenges
- Use the given code to simulate and use the results to use the viz. We want the coders to be able to modify the simulation without having to modify the viz. It should be an independent module
- Understand fully how the model works. 

### Contents 
- design : contains our sketches, our questions we had to design.
- myiris : contains the original code if the IrisModel and the code for the viz.
- images : images ressources

### Notes : 
- The display is not friendly with firefox for some reason it won't load the scripts ~~ fix it asap.
