This project is done with the agent based model created by the FHNW. 
Thus all of the code concerning the agent based model has been done on an other project and we have not contributed at all to it. 
Our work is only on the visualization.
### Abstract 


### Currently doing : 
- Adding a way to start model with specific parameters for each agents
- Zoom into the historical timeline and use a brush to go over
- Select a specific tick to display values by agents type


### Challenges
- Make the model stable for longer simulation
- Hack a way around the given code to make it work with our code
- Do a line plot for historical timeline
- Make it pretty <3 

### Contents 
- design : contains our sketches, our questions we had to design.
- myiris : contains the original code if the IrisModel and the code for the viz.
- images : images ressources

### Notes : 
- The display is not friendly with firefox for some reason it won't load the scripts ~~ fix it asap.
