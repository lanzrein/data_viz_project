  <h1>A study of work patterns in Co-housing situations</h1>
  </div>
  <h2> Introduction </h2>
  <p> GO TO SIMULATION : <a href="myiris/viz.html"> click here </a>
  <p>
    As ressources grow scarce on earth, most society will have to review their lifestyle in order to even survive on the long term.
    While there are a multitude of sociological theories on how humans should behave in a group, the most prevalent one is a capitalistic society where everyone is forced to fight for themselves.
    In 1938 already, a swiss author named Hans Widmer, more commonly known as his pseudonym P.M. , wrote a book called <i>bolo'bolo</i>. In this book, he describes a society built around autonomous communities that would help each others.
    From this book, a team of researcher at the University of Applied Sciences and Arts Northwester Switzerland Academy of Art and Design built a project called Thinking Toys for Commoning.
    One of the axis of the project, was to build an Agent Based Model to simulate the working patterns of a co-housing community.
    Our task was to build a meaningful visualization that would help them to notice the tipping points in the simulation.

  <h2> Objective </h2>
  <p>
    As mentionned above, we were tasked with creating a way to identify tipping points in the simulation.
  </p>
  <h2> Target Audience </h2>
  <p>
    *TODOOO*

  <h1> Concept </h1>
  <h2> Datasets used </h2>

  <p>
    This is a particuliar part of our project, we did not have a specific dataset given.
    Instead we were given the program that could simulate the ABM. The simulation yielded various type of output values and had a few input values.
    To abstract it as a function we can split the ABM as a function with inputs and outputs.
    <h3> Inputs </h3>
    <ul>
      <li>Number of sets of tasks</li>
      <li>Number of agents having "Curious" behavior</li>
      <li>Number of agents having "Capitalis" behavior</li>
      <li>Number of agents having "Perfectionist" behavior</li>
      <li>Number of agents having "Geniesser" behavior</li>
    </ul>

    <p>
      The user of the simulation can choose how many agents of each behavior type he wants and how many tasks should be given by the simulation.
      This way the user can tweak those values to see if any emerging patterns appear.
    </p>

    <h3> Outputs </h3>
    <text> For each agents we have : </text>
    <ul>
      <li>Feel like doing value</li>
      <li>Stress value</li>
      <li>Rest time value</li>
      <li>Amount of time value</li>
      <li>Traded tasks value</li>
      <li>Brute force value</li>
    </ul>

    <p>
      The simulation computes those values depending on the behavior type of the agent.
      For example, a perfectionist agent wants to do always the same task, forcing this agent to do a task that he has no preference for will decrease his "feel like doing" value.
      Brute force value refers to if the agent was forced into doing the task even if he did not want to do it.
